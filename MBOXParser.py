"""This is an mbox filter. It scans through an entire mbox style mailbox
and writes the messages to a new file. Each message is passed
through a filter function which may modify the document or ignore it.

The passthrough_filter() example below simply prints the 'from' email
address and returns the document unchanged. After running this script
the input mailbox and output mailbox should be identical.
